#### Bugs and Requests
The purpose of this repository is to work as the public issue tracker for [cobai.com's store API v2](https://developer.cobai.com). If you've found a bug in the API, or have ideas on how we could improve it, please [create an issue](https://www.github.com/cobai/store-api-v2-docs/issues). It's greatly appreciated.

We differentiate between *enhancement requests* and *feature requests* in that enhancement requests are improvements of existing features, while feature requests are requests for entirely new features.

**If you want to show your support for an existing feature request, please add a [thumbs up reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead of commenting  "_+1_".** This way the creator of the feature request doesn't get bombarded with notifications.

#### OpenAPI Specification
